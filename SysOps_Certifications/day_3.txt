	System Boot Volumes
	Low Latency interactive apps
	development and test environments
2. Provisioned IOPS (SSD) - io1
	Critical Business applications
	used for more than 16000 IOPS
	max limit of IOPS is 64000
	160 IOPS per volume
	Large data base like Cassedra, Mongo db
	
3. Throughput Optimiezed (HDD) - st1
	Big data, data warehouses log processing
	Cannot be a boot volume
	streaming work loads
	fast through put at low price

4. Cold (HDD) - sc1
	Throughput oriented storage for large volumes 
	of data that is infrequently accessed. 
	Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is importantj
