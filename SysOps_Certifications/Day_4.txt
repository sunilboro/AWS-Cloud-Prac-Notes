When It comes to Monitoring caching engines there are 4 main  metrics to look at:
1. CPU Utilizations
2. Swap Usage
3. Evictions
4. Concurrent Connections

Memcache:
Multithreaded
can handle load of upto 90%. If it exceeds 90% add more nodes to the cluster

Redis:
Not Multithreaded. 

Swap Usage:
swap usage is simply the amount of swap files that is used. The Swap file or paging file is the amount of disk storage space reserved
on disk if your computer runs out of ram. Typically the size of swap file is equal to the size of ram. So if you have 4gb of ram
you will have 4gb of swap file.

Memecache:
Should be around 0 most of the time and should not exceed 50 mb.

Redis:
No swap usage metric instead reserved memory. 

Evictions:
Think of Evictions like tenants in apartment building, there are number of empty apartments that slowly fill up with tenants. 
Eventually the apartment block is full, however more tenants need to be added. 
An Eviction occurs when new items is added and an old item is removed due to lack of free space.
