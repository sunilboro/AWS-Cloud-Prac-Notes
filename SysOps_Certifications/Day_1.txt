Monitoring and Metrics

CloudWatch:
CloudWatch is monitoring service to monitor your AWS resources, as well as the applications that run on AWS.

It can monitor things like:
Compute 
Auto Scaling Groups
Elastic Load Balancers
Route53 Health Checks
Storage and Content Delivery
EBS Volumes
Storage Gateways
CloudFront
Databases and Analytics
DynamoDB
Elasticache Nodes
RDS Instances
Elastic MapReduce Job Flows
Redshift
SNS Topics
SQS Queues
OpsWorks
CloudWatch Logs
Estimated Charges on AWS Bills

For EC2 instance these things, CloudWatch monitors by default (5min interval by default)
Host Level Metrics:
CPU
Network
Disk
Status Checks
(Note : RAM Utilization is Custome Metric)

How long CloudWatch metrics are stored:
1. CloudWatch Logs will store data indefinitely
2. Retention for each log group can be changed at any time.
3. we can retrieve this data using GetMetricStatistics API
4. you can retrieve data from any terminated EC2 or ELB instance after its termination

Metric Granularity:
1 min (custom metrics) , 3 min, 5 min


CloudWatch Alarms:
You can create alarm to monitor any Amazon CloudWatch metric in your account. This include EC2 CPU Utilization 
Elastic Load Balancer Latency or even the charges on your AWS bill. You can create appropriate threshold in which to 
trigger the alarms and also set what actions should be taken if an alarm state is reached (SNS notifications, Trigger Lambda function).

with the help of SSM agent and CloudWatch agent we can use CloudWatch on premises.
