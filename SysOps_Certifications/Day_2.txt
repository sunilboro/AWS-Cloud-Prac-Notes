Monitoring and Metrics
EBS - Virtual Disk that we attach to EC2
4 types EBS
1. General Purpose (SSD) - gp2
	Recommended for most workloads
	System Boot volumes
	Virtual Desktops
	Low latency interactive apps
	Development and test environments

2. Provisioned IOPS (SSD) - io1
	Critical Business applications that require sustained IOPS performance or more than 10,000 IOPS or 160MiB/s of throughput per volume
	Large Database workloads such as: MongoDB, Cassendra, Microsoft SQL
	
3. throughput optimized (HDD) - st1
	Streaming workloads requiring consistent, fast throughput at a low price. 
	Big Data warehouses and Log processing
	Cannot be a boot volume
	
4. Cold (HDD) - sc1
	Throughput oriented storage for large volumes of data that is infrequently accessed 
	Scenario where the lowest storage cost is important
	Cannot be a boot volume
