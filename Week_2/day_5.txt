How pricing works?
- AWS offers you a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for over 160 cloud services. With AWS you pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. AWS pricing is similar to how you pay for utilities like water and electricity. You only pay for the services you consume, and once you stop using them, there are no additional costs or termination fees.
- Pay-as-you-go
- Save when you reserve
- Pay less by using more

AWS Pricing Calculator
- Whether you are running a single instance or dozens of individual services, you can estimate your monthly bill using the AWS Pricing Calculator. The calculator allows you to estimate individual or multiple prices and use templates to appraise complete solutions.
