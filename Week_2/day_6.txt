Amazon Elastic Container Registry Documentation - Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

Components of Amazon ECR
Amazon ECR contains the following components:

Registry
An Amazon ECR registry is provided to each AWS account; you can create image repositories in your registry and store images in them. For more information, see Amazon ECR private registries.

Authorization token
Your client must authenticate to Amazon ECR registries as an AWS user before it can push and pull images. For more information, see Private registry authentication.

Repository
An Amazon ECR image repository contains your Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts. For more information, see Amazon ECR private repositories.

Repository policy
You can control access to your repositories and the images within them with repository policies. For more information, see Repository policies.

Image
You can push and pull container images to your repositories. You can use these images locally on your development system, or you can use them in Amazon ECS task definitions and Amazon EKS pod specifications. For more information, see Using Amazon ECR images with Amazon ECS and Using Amazon ECR Images with Amazon EKS.
