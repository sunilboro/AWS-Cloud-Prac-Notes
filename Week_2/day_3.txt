- AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.

- Fargate allocates the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose instances and scale cluster capacity. You only pay for the resources required to run your containers, so there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers. Fargate runs each task or pod in its own kernel providing the tasks and pods their own isolated compute environment. This enables your application to have workload isolation and improved security by design. This is why customers such as Vanguard, Accenture, Foursquare, and Ancestry have chosen to run their mission critical applications on Fargate.

- Benefits
* Deploy and manage applications, not infrastructure
* Right-sized resources with flexible pricing options
* Secure isolation by design
* Rich observability of applications

- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.

-Benefits
No servers to manage
Continuous scaling
Cost optimized with millisecond metering
Consistent performance at any scale

- Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. 

API Types
* RESTful APIs
* WEBSOCKET APIs

- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, share, and deploy your container images and artifacts anywhere. Amazon ECR eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. Amazon ECR hosts your images in a highly available and high-performance architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy images for your container applications.

- Amazon ECR works with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and AWS Lambda.

Benefits
* Reduce your effort with a fully managed registry
* Securely share and download container images
* Provide fast and highly available access
